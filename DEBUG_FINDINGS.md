# Debug Findings: Post Content Not Showing

## Issue Summary
Posts are showing in browser DevTools (DOM elements exist) but not visible on the actual page.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Server TypeScript Not Compiled**
- The server TypeScript code with PostService has been modified but not compiled to JavaScript
- The server is running old compiled JavaScript that may not include the latest fixes
- Added comprehensive logging to debug the issue, but it won't show until recompiled

### 2. **Data Schema Mismatch**
- Client expects status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived'
- Server was defining status as: 'draft' | 'published' | 'private'
- This has been fixed in the TypeScript source

### 3. **Posts Directory Structure**
- Posts directory exists at: `/server/data/posts/`
- Contains 10 markdown files with proper frontmatter
- All posts have status: "published"

## Debug Tools Created

1. **test-posts.html** - Simple HTML file to test API directly
   - Open in browser to see if API returns data
   - Shows real-time debugging information

2. **test-api.js** - Node.js script to test API
   - Run with: `node test-api.js`

3. **compile-server.sh** - Script to compile and restart server
   - Run with: `chmod +x compile-server.sh && ./compile-server.sh`

## Comprehensive Logging Added

### Server-side (PostService):
- Loading posts from directory
- Frontmatter parsing
- Post filtering by status
- API endpoint calls

### Client-side:
- API fetch requests
- Response data
- Post loading in useInfiniteScroll hook

## Next Steps

1. **Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server)

2. **Compile the TypeScript**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the server again**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Check the browser console** for the new logging output

5. **Open test-posts.html** in a browser to verify API is working

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- Server logs will show posts being loaded from markdown files
- API endpoint will return posts with proper structure
- Client will receive and display posts correctly

## Verification Steps

1. Check server console for:
   - "üìÅ Loading posts from directory"
   - "‚úÖ Loaded X posts from markdown files"
   - "üìä getAllPosts called with filters"

2. Check browser console for:
   - "üåê Fetching: http://localhost:2567/api/posts"
   - "üì• Response received"
   - "üìã New posts: [array of posts]"

3. If posts still don't show after compilation:
   - Check browser Network tab for API response
   - Look for any CSS issues (display: none, visibility: hidden)
   - Verify SimplePostCard component is rendering correctly
