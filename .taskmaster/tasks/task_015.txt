# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Performance and Implement Deployment Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize application performance and set up deployment pipeline for production.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading
2. Optimize asset loading and caching
3. Add service worker for offline support
4. Implement server-side rendering or static generation where appropriate
5. Create production build configuration
6. Set up CDN integration
7. Implement automated testing in CI pipeline
8. Create staging and production environments
9. Add monitoring and error tracking
10. Implement automated deployment process
11. Create backup and recovery procedures
12. Optimize database queries and caching

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure and compare performance metrics before and after optimization
2. Test application load time on various network conditions
3. Verify offline functionality with service worker
4. Test automated deployment to staging and production
5. Verify monitoring captures relevant metrics and errors
6. Test recovery procedures from backups
